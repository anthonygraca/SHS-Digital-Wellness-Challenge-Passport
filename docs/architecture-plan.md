# Architecture & Implementation Plan
## SHS Digital Wellness Passport — CSUB Student Health Services (DxHub 2026)

> Mobile-first digital wellness passport with QR check-in, an AI wellness guide, personalized
> health education, and automated assessment/reporting. Standalone, SSO-based, themeable per
> semester, and built to deploy across the 22-campus CSU system.

---

## 1. Requirements distilled (from proposal + discovery call)

| # | Requirement | Source | Architectural consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Mobile-first; "phone is everywhere" | Erika/Nick | **PWA** (installable web app), not native |
| R2 | SAML SSO, no 9-digit ID self-entry; validate *current* student | Brian | Campus IdP via SAML; store only opaque SSO subject |
| R3 | No PHI; standalone; EHR does not integrate | Erika | No clinical data, no EHR calls; FERPA-aware only |
| R4 | QR check-in with manual oversight, "good faith" | Erika/Nick | Event-QR scan → mark week complete |
| R5 | Admin builder: configure N weeks/tasks/quizzes each semester | Erika/Nicholas | Challenge = **data/config**, not code |
| R6 | Re-skin per semester (Stranger Things → Harry Potter) | Nick/Erika | Theme = config (colors, art, copy) |
| R7 | Pull reports: participation, completion, learning outcomes | Lauren | Reporting store + dashboard/export |
| R8 | AI: personalization, conversational guide, auto-scoring | Proposal | Claude via Bedrock + RAG on SHS content |
| R9 | C# + Microsoft SQL Server for ongoing support | Brian | .NET target; Python only as fallback (rewrite risk) |
| R10 | AWS landing zone available; QuickSight in use | Dominique | Host on AWS; Bedrock for AI; QuickSight optional BI |
| R11 | ~200 completers; twice/year; deployable CSU-wide | Erika/Brian | Low steady load, burst at events; multi-tenant-ready |

**Scale reality:** ~200 concurrent-ish completers per challenge, 2 challenges/year, bursty at events.
This is a *small* system. Optimize for clarity, low ops burden, and a clean multi-campus story —
not for scale.

## 2. Recommended platform decisions

### 2.1 PWA over native app  ✅
A native iOS/Android app is overkill for a program that runs twice a year and needs zero app-store
friction for students. A **Progressive Web App** gives: install-to-home-screen, camera access for QR
scanning, push-capable, SSO in-browser, one codebase, instant updates. This is the pragmatic and
correct choice.

**As built (US-6 / FR-C4).** `vite-plugin-pwa` generates the service worker; the manifest lives in
`frontend/src/pwa/manifest.ts` rather than inline in `vite.config.ts` so it is typechecked and
assertable from a test. Four decisions in it are not readable off the code:

**Icons are committed PNGs, not SVG, and not build output.** Chrome's install criteria want a 192x192
and a 512x512. Declaring an SVG instead requires `sizes: "any"`, which is the configuration behind two
open Chromium install bugs (40925759, 40911689) — the one option that reliably breaks installability.
They are rasterised once from the `.svg` sources in `frontend/public/icons/` and committed as brand
assets, so no dependency or CI step exists to rot:

```
cd frontend/public/icons
rsvg-convert -w 192 -h 192 icon.svg          -o pwa-192.png
rsvg-convert -w 512 -h 512 icon.svg          -o pwa-512.png
rsvg-convert -w 512 -h 512 icon-maskable.svg -o pwa-maskable-512.png
rsvg-convert -w 180 -h 180 icon.svg          -o apple-touch-icon-180.png
```

The maskable variant is scaled to 0.98 rather than filling the tile because the platform crops it to a
guaranteed circle of 80% of the width: the mark's circumradius, not its bounding box, is what has to
fit. `apple-touch-icon` is not redundant — iOS ignores manifest icons for the home screen entirely.

**`start_url` is `/passport`, not `/`.** `/` routes through the landing, which fetches enrollment
status unconditionally, so an offline launch from the home screen would open on "we couldn't load your
challenge". The installed app's user is by definition a student mid-challenge. The cost is that
`/passport` must redirect admins to `/admin` (staff would otherwise land on "not eligible to join"),
and that an un-enrolled student who installs sees "no active challenge yet" with no route to the join
CTA — accepted, as an un-enrolled student has no reason to install.

**`workbox.navigateFallbackDenylist` is load-bearing, not hygiene.** `navigateFallback` defaults to
`index.html`, and Workbox answers *any* navigation it handles with the precached shell. `/auth/login`
is a top-level redirect into the SAML IdP, not a fetch, so without the denylist a live service worker
serves it the SPA: the catch-all route bounces to `/` and the student is stranded on a sign-in button
that does nothing. This was inert only while the manifest shipped `icons: []` and the app could never
install — adding icons is what arms it. Verified by removing the denylist and watching sign-in break.

**Offline data is a localStorage snapshot, not a Workbox runtime cache.** The service worker precaches
only the app shell. `frontend/src/offline/snapshot.ts` stores the last session and passport; the
consumers (`SessionProvider`, the `Passport` container) catch the rejected fetch and fall back. This
splits cleanly from the SW — it is unit-testable in jsdom, where no service worker runs — and it keeps
the *staleness* visible to the UI, which a transparent cache cannot express.

Two invariants hold it together. **A snapshot only ever survives because we were offline:** the server
is the authority on who is signed in, so an authoritative signed-out clears both keys, and sign-out
clears them unconditionally whether or not the server could be reached — this is an SSO subject plus
participation data on a phone students share (no PHI, but close enough to not leave lying around).
And **only a successful fetch writes:** `fetchPassport` returns null for any `!res.ok` including a
transient 500, so clearing on null would cost a student their offline passport over one blip.

`navigator.onLine` drives only what we *say* — the banner and the refusal — never the fallback. It
reports whether an interface exists, so a captive portal reports online while every fetch fails; the
fallback keys off the rejected fetch instead, which cannot be fooled that way.

**Check-ins are refused offline, never queued.** Deliberate, and not merely because the story says so:
the server validates each QR token's freshness, so a scan replayed on reconnect would be rejected
anyway — after the student had already been shown a completed week. A background-sync queue here would
be a promise the system cannot keep. Do not add one.

Known gap: the Roboto/Oswald/Cinzel stack loads from Google Fonts, so an offline passport falls back
to system fonts. Cosmetic, and fixable with the standard Workbox font-caching recipe if it matters.

### 2.2 The QR check-in model  ✅
Two directions exist; support the simple one first, keep the strong one as a config option.

- **Event QR (default):** Staff display a QR at the event. Student scans it in-app → backend marks
  that week complete for the authenticated student. Captures attendance automatically (the metric
  Lauren wants) with near-zero staff effort.
  - *Anti-gaming for production:* make the QR a **signed, short-lived token that rotates every
    ~30–60s** on the staff screen, so a screenshot can't be shared off-site. Prototype can use a
    static per-event code.
- **Staff-scans-student (option):** For higher-assurance events (labs), staff scans the student's
  personal passport QR. Same endpoint, `method = staff_verified`.

Both funnel to one `POST /checkins` endpoint that records `{student, task, timestamp, method}`.
This directly replaces clickers + stickers and is the automatic attendance capture SHS asked for.

### 2.3 Challenge-as-config  ✅
A "challenge" (weeks, tasks, dates, prizes, quiz items, theme) is **data**, authored in the admin
builder — never code. Re-skinning and re-sequencing each semester is then a content operation, which
is exactly how Erika/Lauren already think ("I just put in 6 weeks, 8 weeks").

```

**One API, two front-end surfaces** (student PWA, admin PWA) sharing an auth layer. Everything AI
routes through the API so guardrails, grounding, and logging are centralized — the model is never
called directly from the browser.

## 4. Tech stack

| Layer | Production choice | Why | Camp-prototype note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Front end | **React PWA** (or Blazor WASM) + `html5-qrcode`/`BarcodeDetector` | Mobile-first, installable, camera QR | Same; theme via CSS variables |
| API | **ASP.NET Core (C#)** Web API | R9 — team-supportable, CSU-standard | Build in .NET to match prod |
| DB | **Microsoft SQL Server** (Amazon RDS) | R9/R10 | SQLite/LocalDB fine for demo |
| Auth | **SAML** via campus IdP (`Sustainsys.Saml2` for .NET) | R2, CSU-wide | Mock IdP or single test SP for demo |
| AI | **Claude (Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 5) via Amazon Bedrock** | On AWS already; enterprise data controls | Same; keep prompts server-side |
| RAG | OpenSearch Serverless *or* pgvector *or* SQL-native vector | Ground guide + tips in SHS content | Start with a small in-memory/JSON index |
| Hosting | **AWS App Runner or ECS Fargate** + CloudFront | Simple container ops on their landing zone | App Runner is fastest to demo |
| Media/content | **S3** (`dxhub-camp-2026-csub-shs-digital-wellness`) + CloudFront | Already provisioned | Reuse existing bucket |
| Reporting | SQL views → **QuickSight** | Dominique already uses "Quick" | CSV export is enough for demo |
| Secrets | AWS Secrets Manager | No creds in code | — |

**Stack recommendation:** build the prototype **in .NET + SQL Server** even for the camp. The sponsor
(Brian) explicitly named C#/MS SQL as the condition for ongoing support and CSU-wide adoption, so a
.NET prototype *is* the adoption pitch — it demos the real production path, not a throwaway. A
Python/FastAPI prototype would ship marginally faster but carries an explicit rewrite cost Brian
flagged in the call ("our team is not trained on that… what does ongoing support mean"). Only fall
back to Python if the camp team has no C# capability at all.

## 5. Data model (no PHI)

```
Challenge(id, campus_id, name, theme_id, semester, starts_on, ends_on, status)
Theme(id, name, palette_json, logo_url, hero_url,                     -- R6 skinning
      app_title, tagline, copy_tone)
Task(id, challenge_id, week_no, title, caption, activity_type,        -- R5 the "weeks"
     location, date_start, date_end, prize, is_required, order)
QuizItem(id, task_id, kind[mcq|reflection], prompt, options_json,     -- R8 assessment
         answer_key, rubric_json, learning_outcome_tag)

Student(id, campus_id, sso_subject, affiliation, created_at)          -- R2/R3 minimal identity
Enrollment(id, student_id, challenge_id, enrolled_at)

CheckIn(id, student_id, task_id, ts, method[event_qr|staff|manual],   -- R4 replaces sticker/clicker
        verified_by)
CheckInAudit(id, campus_id, student_id, task_id, checkin_id,          -- FR-D6 append-only ledger
             action[create|update|delete], actor_subject, reason, ts,
             prior_state_json, new_state_json)                         -- NO FKs; see below
QuizResponse(id, student_id, quiz_item_id, response, score,           -- R8 auto-scored
             ai_feedback, scored_by[auto|human], ts)
ContentView(id, student_id, task_id, content_ref, ts)                 -- engagement metric
PrizeEligibility  -- DERIVED VIEW: student completed all is_required tasks in a challenge
```

**Identity:** the only identifier stored is the SAML `sso_subject` (e.g. eduPersonPrincipalName) plus
affiliation. No name-typing, no 9-digit ID, no PHI. Uniqueness is guaranteed by the IdP (solves
Erika's "two students, same name" concern).

**Prize eligibility is a query, not a flag** — derived from completion of required tasks, so it's
always correct and auditable.

**The audit ledger carries no foreign keys (FR-D6).** `CheckIn` stays the single source of truth for
"is this complete?"; `CheckInAudit` is the append-only record of who changed it, when, why, and what
it looked like before. It is deliberately *not* FK'd to `checkins`, `students`, or `tasks`: a check-in
row is hard-deleted when an admin removes a completion, and students/tasks cascade-delete their
dependents — so an FK could only cascade (destroying the very evidence FR-D6 exists to guarantee) or
SET NULL (losing the correlation). `RESTRICT` would preserve the ledger but block legitimate task
deletion. Instead each row carries a self-contained JSON snapshot (including the student's
`sso_subject`, never a name) plus plain indexed integers, so it outlives anything it points at.
`campus_id` is denormalized onto the row for the same reason: audit reads stay campus-isolated after
the task is gone.

Two consequences worth knowing. `method="manual"` does **not** by itself mean "an admin did this" —
a student's own passport check-in also writes `manual`; the admin override is identified by
`verified_by` being set plus the presence of an audit row. And SQLite ships `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF`
and the app never enables it, so the `ondelete="CASCADE"` declarations elsewhere are currently inert
and would only start firing on Postgres — the FK-free ledger is correct under both.

**As built (US-18 / FR-E4).** The sketch above says `QuizItem` / `QuizResponse`; the shipped models
are `AssessmentItem` (US-12) and `AssessmentResponse`, both in `models/challenge.py`. The name follows
the code. Five decisions are not readable off it:

**The outcome tag is joined, not copied onto the response.** `AssessmentResponse` reaches its tag
through `assessment_item_id`. Denormalizing it — as `CheckInAudit` does `campus_id` — looks
symmetrical and is wrong here: that ledger carries no FKs and must outlive its referents, whereas a
response cascade-deletes with its item and can never outlive it. The decisive case is US-12's
`AssessmentItemUpdate`, which lets an admin edit `outcome_tag`. A copied tag would leave old scores
filed under the old tag, so the learning-outcome report below would count one item under two tags with
no principled answer for which is right. Joining means retagging an item retags its whole score
history — which is what retagging an item means.

**An MCQ is one attempt** (`uq_response_student_item`, 409 on a second), and this is load-bearing
rather than tidy. It is paired with the decision below and neither survives alone: the instant
feedback names the correct option, so retries would make every stored score a 1.0 and flatten the
learning-outcome aggregate into noise. If retries are ever wanted, the constraint is what has to go,
and the report must then average *first* attempts only.

**The feedback names the correct option**, because a verdict alone teaches nothing and FR-E4 exists to
teach. It is composed server-side (the client never holds the key) and templated, not generated —
AI-authored feedback against a rubric is US-19 / FR-E5. `ai_feedback` is deliberately absent from the
model: it is nullable, so US-19 adds it additively at no cost, whereas a column nothing can write is
just debt. `scored_by` went in now for the opposite reason — it is `NOT NULL`, there is no Alembic,
and adding it later would mean dropping every existing database.

**The student never receives `answer_key`.** `AssessmentItemOut` carries it and `TaskOut` embeds it;
that is safe only because every route serving them is admin-gated. The student surface has its own
`KnowledgeCheckItemOut` with no such field *at all*, so it cannot leak one even when built from an ORM
item — a leaked key makes auto-scoring theatre, since the client could score itself. The regression
test asserts on shape, not on the absence of the answer text: the correct option is necessarily in the
body, being one of the four the student picks between. What must not be there is anything marking it.

**The quiz lives in the week sheet, not on a route.** The design mockup's S6 screen hangs off a "Learn"
tab in a bottom nav this app does not have, so a standalone screen would need an entry point invented
for it. Worth knowing before US-19 adds the reflection surface and meets the same wall — the mockup
also assumes a fuller Material 3 token set (`--wp-secondary-container` and friends) that
`theme/tokens.css` does not define, and an undefined custom property is not a fallback, it is nothing.

**Theme is data, not code (R6 / NFR-6).** `Theme.id` is a slug that doubles as the SPA's
`data-theme` value, so a theme's static token block still skins the app if its row is missing.
`palette_json` maps a CSS custom-property suffix to its value (`{"primary": "#ff4438"}`), which the
SPA applies as `--wp-*` over that block. The asset fields are `*_url` rather than the object-store
`*_key` originally sketched — there is no asset store yet, so admins supply URLs; swapping to keys
is a later change behind the same API. Copy is split into `app_title` / `tagline` (the strings the
app renders) and `copy_tone` (the descriptor authors write to). The student's passport response
embeds the *resolved* theme, so a re-skin ships no code.

**Duplication is a deep copy, not a template link (FR-B6).** `POST /api/challenges/{id}/duplicate`
re-inserts the `Challenge`, its `Task` rows (positions preserved, so the gapless 1..N invariant holds
for free) and their `QuizItem`s as new rows. The copy is always `draft` and carries no `Enrollment`s
or `CheckIn`s — those belong to the original's run, not to the template. Task QR tokens need no
handling at all: they are derived from task id, so copies mint their own. Dates are copied verbatim;
there is no academic calendar to shift Fall→Spring against, and a draft is invisible to students
until published, so stale dates are inert until the admin retimes them.

The one wrinkle is `uq_challenge_campus_name_sem`: a copy cannot reuse name+semester. The request
body's `name`/`semester` are both optional, and an omitted name makes the server derive the first
free `"<base> (Copy)"` / `"(Copy N)"`, stripping any existing suffix so copies of copies don't stack.
That derivation is what the admin UI relies on — it posts a name only when the admin actually types
one, because echoing our own suggestion back would collide on the second duplicate into a semester
rather than yielding `(Copy 2)`. An explicit, admin-chosen collision still returns 409.

## 6. The AI layer (the actual differentiator)

All three AI capabilities are grounded in **SHS-approved content** (RAG) and run server-side through
Bedrock. This is what makes it "AI value," not just digital tracking.

### 6.1 Personalized health education (post-check-in)
On each check-in, generate/select a tailored tip + resource + short video, personalized by: which
task, remaining progress, prior engagement, and any student-stated interests. Grounded in SHS
materials so content is on-brand and accurate. *Example from the call:* scan the vision-check QR →
"Get your eyes checked annually — here's why, and here's the campus follow-up."

### 6.2 Conversational wellness guide (themed chatbot)
An in-app assistant skinned to the theme ("Portal Guide" for Stranger Things, "Marauder's Map guide"
for Harry Potter) that answers wellness questions, nudges the next task, and points to campus
resources. **Guardrails (non-negotiable):**
- Educational, **not** medical advice; no diagnosis, no treatment recommendations.
- Answers grounded in retrieved SHS content; refuses/deflects out-of-scope.
- **Crisis routing:** any self-harm/urgent signal → immediate handoff to real services (988,
  campus counseling, SHS front desk) — hard-coded, not model-discretion.
- No PHI collected in chat; conversation minimally logged for improvement.

### 6.3 Automated assessment (replaces hand-scored paper)
- **MCQ knowledge checks:** auto-scored instantly.
- **Reflections:** Claude scores free-text against a per-item rubric mapped to a
  `learning_outcome_tag`, producing a score + short feedback. Aggregates into the learning-outcomes
  report Lauren scores by hand today. Human can override (`scored_by = human`).

### 6.4 AI-assisted admin builder (the sleeper feature)
Erika authors challenges as a Word doc today (we have the Stranger Things one). Let the admin **paste
or upload that doc → Claude drafts the structured challenge**: weeks, tasks, date windows, prizes,
themed captions/taglines, and starter quiz items — which the admin then edits. This maps directly to
their real workflow and turns a multi-day setup into minutes. Strong demo moment: ingest
`Stranger Things Challenge.docx` live and watch the challenge configure itself.

---

## 7. Admin experience

- **Builder:** create challenge → set weeks/tasks/dates/prizes → attach quiz items → pick/adjust
  theme. AI-assisted draft from source doc (§6.4).
- **Live ops:** generate event QR codes; view real-time check-in counts; manual override/mark.
- **Reporting (R7):** participation, check-in-vs-manual, completion funnel by week, engagement
  (content views/chat use), learning-outcome scores, prize-eligibility export. SQL views feeding
  QuickSight; CSV export for the registrar/prize drawing.

---

## 8. Privacy, safety & compliance

- **No PHI** stored or transmitted; challenge participation only (R3).
- **FERPA-aware:** participation is a student record — access-controlled, aggregated for reporting.
- **Minimal identity:** SSO subject + affiliation only; authorization can require
  "current student" attributes from the assertion (answers Lauren's past-student question).
- **AI safety:** grounding + refusal + crisis routing (§6.2); prompts and guardrails server-side;
  Bedrock keeps data within the AWS account (no training on your data).
- **Multi-campus/tenancy:** `campus_id` on every row; SAML issuer → campus mapping. Same codebase
  deploys per campus (Brian's CSU-wide path).

---

## 9. Build plan (camp week → Friday demo)

Prioritized so that each phase is independently demoable; stop wherever time runs out.

- **Phase 0 — Done.** Data pulled from S3 (passport, challenge doc, discovery call).
- **Phase 1 — Core loop (must-have).** SSO login → enroll → see weeks with progress countdown →
  scan event QR → week marked complete. Seed with the real **Stranger Things** 7-week challenge.
- **Phase 2 — AI value (the demo's heart).** Post-check-in personalized tip + themed conversational
  wellness guide (Bedrock/Claude + small RAG index of SHS content) with guardrails.
- **Phase 3 — Assessment.** MCQ knowledge check + AI-scored reflection feeding a learning-outcome
  number.
- **Phase 4 — Admin + reporting.** Builder with **AI doc-ingest** (live-configure from the Word
  doc), theming toggle, and a reporting view. This is the sponsor-facing "you'll actually use this"
  moment.
- **Stretch.** Rotating signed QR, QuickSight dashboard, second theme (Harry Potter) to prove
  re-skinning, push notifications for weekly nudges.

**Friday demo narrative:** log in as a student (SSO) → Stranger Things passport → scan a vision-check
QR → instant completion + personalized tip → ask the Portal Guide a question → take a knowledge
check → flip to admin → ingest the Word doc to build next semester's challenge → show the completion
& learning-outcome report.

## 10. Success metrics (instrumented from day one)

| Proposal metric | How the system measures it |
|---|---|
| Challenge completion rate | Enrollments vs. students completing all required tasks |
| Auto vs. hand attendance | `CheckIn.method` breakdown (event_qr/staff vs manual) |
| Engagement | ContentViews + chat sessions per student |
| Learning-outcome scores | Aggregated QuizResponse scores by `learning_outcome_tag` |
| Staff hours saved | Baseline (sticker/clicker/hand-scoring time) vs. near-zero after |
| Participant satisfaction | Optional end-of-challenge in-app survey |

---

## 11. Open questions to confirm with SHS / ITS

1. **Prototype stack:** confirm .NET (recommended) vs. Python for the camp build — capability check.
2. **QR assurance level:** static event code (simplest) vs. rotating signed token (anti-gaming)?
3. **SSO for the demo:** is a CSUB test IdP/SP available this week, or do we mock SAML for Friday?
4. **Bedrock access:** is Claude enabled in the account/region on the landing zone?
5. **Content for RAG:** which SHS wellness materials are cleared to ground the guide/tips?
6. **Crisis-routing resources:** exact campus counseling / SHS numbers to hard-code.
```
